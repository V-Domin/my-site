        <h2 class="story-title story-subtitle">When Life Throws a Curveball: How I Found My Passion for Programming</h2>
        <p>As an English teacher with 4+ years of experience, I never thought that my life would take a sudden turn toward programming. However, you never know. By chance, most of my adult clients happened to be IT specialists, and their stories about programming always intrigued me. It felt like another world, and I knew nothing about it.</p>
        <p>Then, everything changed when a full-scale russian invasion hit my country. I found myself unable to work or attend classes at the University. So, I decided to take up coding, something that I never would have considered before, just to keep my mind busy.</p>
        <p>Python was my gateway language, and I threw myself into it, passing one course after another. I spent a lot of time studying, and I couldn't get enough. It felt like a whole new world had opened up to me.</p>
        <p>A year has passed since then, and I haven't stopped exploring. I've been lucky enough to work with various programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including Python and Flask, Django, CSS/HTML, and Bootstrap. I created projects like <a href="work.html#teachhub-project-p">teachHub</a> and <a href="work.html#brew-balance-w">BrewBalance</a>, which I'm particularly proud of. Recently, I've started learning JavaScript and even created a simple project called <a href="work.html#lana-project-p">Lana's Game</a>, which is a prototype of the "Simon Game" but based on Lana Del Rey's songs.</p>
        <p>It hasn't been an easy path, but it has been rewarding. I'm having a beautiful time exploring the world of programming, and I'm thrilled to continue on this path. And now, I'm even available for hire! Who would have thought that my chance encounters with IT specialists would lead me here? Life is full of surprises.</p>
